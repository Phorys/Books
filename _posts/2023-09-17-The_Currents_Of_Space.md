## Review
"The Currents of Space" by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the Galactic Empire series. It is a story, which reads much like a mystery, while also portraying a society with a clear distinction between the upper and lower class. The societal pressures that exist in such a society are clearly displayed and it is distinctly influenced by the differences between capitalism and communism. It is these differences and the undertones of this type of community, which will keep the book indefinitely relevant.

The book manages to display the fragility of a society that is largely based on greed, a motivation that only breeds more greed. When the wealth of a society is consolidated on few hands and greed still prevails it is becomes evident that the only way to increase ones wealth is to take it from someone else, which in turn leads to mistrust and corruption. This concept is at the core of the book. And even more so, what if the wealth of the society is not sustainable in the long term?

The themes that is covered in this book a covered in much other Science Fiction from the same era and earlier. Specifically "War with the Newts" by Karel ÄŒapek springs to mind. "The Sirens of Titan" by Kurt Vonnegut is similar in terms of theme and story, yet not in terms of style. Also a comparison to "Ubik" by Philip K. Dick could be mentioned, yet this "The Currents of Space" is more straight-forward. 

## Score: 8/10
Personally, I find that Isaac Asimov is one of my favourite authors. His main strength is the ability to never stray from the path he lays down. He is the master of having a clarity of vision and following that vision all the way through, with little to no detours. It is so masterfully executed that almost any book feels like a breeze to read, yet the true depth of the book lies in the reflection after you have finished and realise the true depth of the story you've been told.
