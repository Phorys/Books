## Review
"Dangerous Visions" by Harlan Ellison is a short-story collection with more than 30 stories, heralding the beginning of the new wave of science fiction. It contains a number excellent stories by a number of well-renowned and excellent writers. Some of the stories manage to impact you in a manner of a few pages, while others you wish would just keep going. The best part of anthologies is that it often manages to present one with a range of different styles and discover new authors, that you didn't know about, but can now delve further into.

Each story is introduced with personal anecdotes and introductions by Harlan Ellison, who manages to make each authoer into a relatable person, while also managing to explain where each of the stories fit into the grander scope of things. Clearly, a large amount of effort was put into creating this anthology and the result is simply astonishing.

For people just getting into science fiction, this book is an excellent place to start in order to be able to find different "flavours" of authors to be further studied later. It can be well and truly recommended. I have personally found some authors, who I will be reading more books from.

## Score: 10/10
Reading this book it cannot be scored less than 10 out of 10. The amount, the quality and the authors behind the stories is nothing short of remarkable.
