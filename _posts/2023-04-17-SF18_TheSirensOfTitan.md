## Review
"The Sirens of Titan" by Kurt Vonnegut is a book, which seeks to explore the point of life in regards to the universe, while also providing a casual comment of the randomness of it all. I find that it sets out on a journey to, in some roundabout way, find the true meaning of life.

The book itself is well-written and it is a fun read, yet somehow the view of futility it presents can almost seem depressing at times, which is at the same time the whole point. Fortunately, the inventiveness of the author and the true craziness of the tale outweighs this feeling and makes it entertaining throughout. If one has previously read other books by Kurt Vonnegut and liked them, this book does definitely not disappoint.

I should add that this book lands very much in the same range of books as "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams and if one is interested in a fantastical tale and simply wishes there was a bit more crazy in the world, then this is not a bad place to go. I imagine a younger audience would find it quite entertaining.

## Score: 6/10
Based on the two books I've read by Kurt Vonnegut I find that he can be a bit of an acquired taste - A taste I have yet to acquire it seems. I cannot fault the book, yet I hoped for something a little more profound. "Slaughterhouse-Five" had to me a stronger connection to reality, which I gained something from, while "The Sirens of Titan" is, in my view, a little too detached from reality to glean much from.
