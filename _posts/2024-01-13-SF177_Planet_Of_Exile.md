## Review
"Planet of Exile" by Ursula K. Le Guin is the second book in the Hainish Cycle and is an impressive feat in many ways. The book itself is quite short, but what makes it impressive is the ability to create such a rich world in so few pages. The world she presents is one in which an advanced race has been stranded for centuries, exiled and hoping for rescue. It is a world in which a year lasts a lifetime of 60 years, so one will experience all four seaons a once and thus legend is often created, as nobody will remember the last time a season came around. Being stranded can be difficult, when your race is obviously different from the natives, but being an advanced species is often not a guarantee for safety, while differences often lead to an even stronger feeling of loneliness in exile.

The book focuses on two neighbouring cities, which are of two different races, where both are preparing for winter. According to legend winter brings a threat from the North and a large enough threat can often force two socities, that do not normally wish to do so, to cooperate. If one is exiled, perhaps that label is best dealt with by making your exile into your home.

The easiest book to compare to would be "Helliconia" by Brian Aldiss, this is the short story version of that book to a very large degree. Also, it seems that this book serves as a very strong inspiration for "A Song of Ice and Fire" by George R. R. Martin, the world-building is somewhat similar, though one is fantasy and the other is science fiction.

## Score: 8/10
Ursula K. Le Guin's style is unique among science fiction writers, as she is often almost poetic in style and her inspiration from religious sources is often evident, but often well-considered and gives her writing a spiritual side, that not many writers can bring to light. Her style is thoughtful and well-constructed, it is based on thought rather than sudden surprises to drive the plot. She explores what it means to be human and uses science fiction as a laboratory to test her hypotheses.
