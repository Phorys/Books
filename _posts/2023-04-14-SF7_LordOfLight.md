## Review
"Lord of Light" by Roger Zelazny is without a doubt a masterpiece. This conclusion is indisputable, the reason for this is that Roger Zelazny is an author who is both effortless and obviously in love with words and the timelessness of the book means, that if someone argued that it had been written yesterday I would happily accept the argument. Rarely, have I read a book, where it is so obvious that the author simply just loves to write and any budding writer should look to Roger Zelazny for inspiration on style.

I might be fortunate enough to know very little about hinduism and buddhism and therefore not be able to know whether or not the representations are accurate. In some way, I do not feel I have learned much about the subjects, yet it also doesn't matter, because the journey I have been on has been so thoroughly entertaining with powers beyond imagination, which brings into light what it means to be a God - For better or worse.

It is often compared to "Dune" by Frank Herbert, due to the religious tenets and the time both books were written. Much further comparison is difficult to make, because the scale of what Frank Herbert did with "Dune" does not compare to just writing a marvelous and vibrant story. If I were to describe the book in terms of other books it would be a love-child between "Dune" and "Red Rising" by Pierce Brown with a dash of light-heartedness added into the mix.

## Score: 10/10
I feel I have been blessed to have been able to read this book by Roger Zelazny (though preferably not by the Gods presented in the book!). It is obvious why he has won many awards for his books and I know it will not be long before I read the next book by Roger Zelazny. I have wavered between scoring the book a 9 or a 10. I find that I would've liked to come away wiser than when I first sat down with the book and I do not feel that this was achieved. However, the book set out to entertain and this is did perfectly well. The deciding factor must've been the part of the book known only as "the pun", maybe you miss it as a reader, but once it is found it encapsulates the whole spirit of the book.
