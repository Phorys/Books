title: "Welcome!"

The purpose for this is for me to be able to have a single place, where I write up the books that I've read. There are many books to read and the time available for anyone to do so is limited and often feels short. Therefore, a single place to write down short reviews should help to remember which books might be worth revisiting at a later point in time. Now, the offset for this is to focus on the SF Masterworks series by [Gollancz.co.uk](https://www.gollancz.co.uk/tag/sf-masterworks/), which contains around 200 books. The posts here will thus be numbered, but they will not be in order of release - They will instead be following the list provided by [WorldsWithoutEnd.com](https://www.worldswithoutend.com/lists_sf_masterworks.asp) - However also not in order as I have already made a headstart and will randomly select books from the list.
